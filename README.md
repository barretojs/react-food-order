# Food Order

A simple food order app using React with Typescript.
The code is from a course I took("React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)") but I added a few things.
I plan to use this repository as a start to my Portfolio for React since it uses most concepts that a develop would use in a daily basis to develop React applications:

- Hooks (useReducer, useState, etc)
- Context (useContext, no redux tho.)
- Portals
- Refs

## About the course

Really enjoyed the course, it was the best React course I took so far. It goes from VERY basic React to mid/advanced concepts, like how React does optimization behind the scenes and such.
I'm still taking the course(currently at the Next.js session as I'm writing this) but soon I'll be finishing it.

## Extra stuff

Since I've already been working with React for the past year, I tried to add some things to the code that are good practices. Some of the stuff I added so far that are not originally from the course code:

- Linting with ESLint
- Typescript
- Testing (WIP)
- More features (WIP)

Besides adding those things, I fixed a few issues from the original code:

- Responsiveness issues
- Adding from cart was doubling the amount of items instead of addding just one

I'm looking for more things to add to the code. I'll also probably add a backend layer to the app to use HTTP requests.

## Running the code

```
git clone git@github.com:barretojs/react-food-order.git
cd react-food-order
npm i
npm start
```
